# FRC Scout
Combining the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology, FIRST Robotics Competition is the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”

Under strict rules, limited resources, and an intense six-week time limit, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting FIRST Championship.

Information is critical. FRC Scout is an application that improves upon the process of gathering information from other teams, or "scouting". Users on the mobile side are able to meet with other teams on the fly and input it all on the mobile app. Data can then be submitted to the web server where it becomes available for everyone to view.

At competitions access to internet is never guaranteed. FRCScout is offline compatible with the option to update / submit individual sections once a connection is acquired.
