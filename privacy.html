    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Updated: <b>October 11, 2019</b></p>

    <h3>The short version</h3>
    <p>
        We collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the minimum amount of personal information
        that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we
        only use it as this Privacy Policy describes.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

    <h3>What information FRCScout collects and why</h3>

    <h4>Categories of personal information</h4>
    <p>"User Personal Information" is any personal information about one of our users which could, alone or together
        with other information, personally identify them. Information such as a user name and password, an email
        address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of "User Personal Information." User Personal Information
        includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
    <p>"Technical Information" may include information we collect from website browsers, such as web server logs, or
        other log information, such as User session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User
        Personal Information such as a username or an email address, or to other potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>
    <p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use
        aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and
        service.</p>

    <h4>Information from users with accounts</h4>
    <p>If you <b>create an account</b>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will
        create your own user name and password, we will ask you for a valid email address and may ask for "User Personal
        Information."</p>

    <h4>Information from website browsers</h4>
    <p>
        If you're <b>just browsing the website</b>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We
        use common internet technologies, such as sessions and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody,
        whether they have an account or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor's browser type, language
        preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We
        also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
    </p>

    <h4>Our legal basis for processing information</h4>
    <p>Under certain international laws (including GDPR), FRCScout is required to notify you about the legal basis on
        which we process User Personal Information. FRCScout processes User Personal Information on the following legal
        bases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Contract Performance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you create a FRCScout account, you provide your user name, email address, first and last name.
                    We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we
                    process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and
                    email address on other bases.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Consent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a user, you can fill out the information in your user profile, and you have the option to provide
                    User Personal Information such as your full name to a third party website. If you decide to
                    participate in a FRCScout research project or survey, you may choose to provide User Personal
                    Information or other personal information to us for limited purposes. We process this information on
                    the basis of consent.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Legitimate Interests:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the
                    purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain
                    ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of FRCScout's systems, website, and
                    service, we must keep logs of Technical Information; and, in order to respond to legal process, we
                    are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What information FRCScout does not collect</h3>

    <p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers,
        genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although FRCScout does not request or intentionally
        collect any other sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in
        your account such as in your profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are
        responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>
    <p>If you're a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not have an account on FRCScout. FRCScout does
        not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we
        learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to
        close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age
        for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use FRCScout without obtaining your
        parents' or legal guardians' consent.</p>
    <p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is <strong>stored in your account</strong> or
        other free-form content inputs. Information in your account belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as
        well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Any personal information within a
        user's account is the responsibility of the account owner.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>How we share the information we collect</h3>
    We <b>do not</b> share, sell, rent, or trade any User Personal Information with third parties.

    <hr>

    <h3>Our use of sessions and tracking</h3>
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>
        FRCScout uses sessions to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use sessions (and similar
        technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in and remember your preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your
        browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely
        visiting FRCScout; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The sessions FRCScout
        sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality. By using our
        website, you agree that we can place these types of sessions on your computer or device. If you disable your
        browser or device's ability to accept sessions, you will not be able to log in or use FRCScout's services.
    </p>

    <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
    <p>
        We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don't use it to track you individually or
        collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website
        performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use FRCScout. This helps us evaluate our users' use
        of FRCScout; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP
        address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about
        your use of FRCScout. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user
        name.
    </p>
    <p>
        FRCScout will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users
        individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with
        your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on
        to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain pages on our site may set other third party sessions. For example, we may embed content, such as videos,
        from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party sessions, we can't always
        control what sessions this third party content sets.
