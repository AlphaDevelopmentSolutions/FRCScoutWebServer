    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Updated: <b>October 11, 2019</b></p>

    <p>
        Thank you for using FRCScout! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully
        before accessing or using FRCScout. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have
        tried to make it as clear as possible</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>A. Definitions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>An "Account" represents your legal relationship with FRCScout. A "User Account" represents an individual
            User's authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User's identity on FRCScout.
            "Organizations" are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users
            where multiple Users can collaborate. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
        </li>
        <li>The "Agreement" refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this
            document (the "Terms of Service" or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the
            FRCScout Privacy Statement) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
        </li>
        <li>"Content" refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text,
            data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other
            materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also
            includes Services. "User-Generated Content" is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our
            Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
        </li>
        <li>"FRCScout," "We," and "Us" refer to FRCScout, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries,
            contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
        </li>
        <li>The "Service" refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by FRCScout, including
            any Beta Previews.
        </li>
        <li>"The User," "You," and "Your" refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or
            is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of
            the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
        </li>
        <li>The "Website" refers to FRCScout's website located at <a href="https://www.frcscout.com/">FRCScout.com</a>,
            <a href="https://www.frcscout.ca/">FRCScout.ca</a>, <a href="https://www.frcscout.app/">FRCScout.app</a>,
            and all content, services, and products provided by FRCScout at or through the Website. It also refers to
            FRCScout-owned subdomains of FRCScout.com, such as education.FRCScout.com and pages.FRCScout.com.
            Occasionally, websites owned by FRCScout may provide different or additional terms of service. If those
            additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or
            service.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>B. Account Terms</h3>

    <h4>1. Account Controls</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the
                Content within it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate
                administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner
                can manage User access to the Organization's data and projects. An Organization may have multiple
                owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you
                are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are
                performed on or through that Organization.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Required Information</h4>
    <p>You must provide a your first name, last name and a valid email address in order to complete the signup
        process.</p>

    <h4>3. Account Requirements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not
            permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
        </li>
        <li>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the
            Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used
            exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but
            the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than
            one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.
        </li>
        <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine
            account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
        </li>
        <li>You must be age 13 or older. FRCScout does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit
            any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that
            User's Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country's
            minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws.
        </li>
        <li>Your login may only be used by one person - i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.</li>
        <li>You may not use FRCScout in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other
            applicable jurisdiction. You may not use FRCScout if you are or are working on behalf of a <a
                    href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx">Specially
                Designated National (SDN)</a> or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions
            administered by a U.S. government agency. FRCScout may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or
            territories to access certain FRCScout services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. User Account Security</h4>
    <p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is
            posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
        </li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. FRCScout cannot and will not
            be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
        </li>
        <li>You will promptly notify FRCScout if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service
            through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Acceptable Use</h3>
    <p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws,
        export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that
        your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>

    <h3>D. User-Generated Content</h3>
    <h4>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>
    <p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the
        content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or
        otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any
        public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>
    <h4>2. FRCScout may remove content</h4>
    <p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or
        remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any FRCScout terms or policies.</p>
    <h4>3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h4>
    <p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create
        yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will
        only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party
        licenses relating to Content you post.</p>
    <p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us - and other FRCScout
        Users - certain legal permissions. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that
        already comes with a license granting FRCScout the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license
        is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted. The licenses
        you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.</p>
    <h4>4. License Grant to Us</h4>
    <p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal
        successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to
        render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database
        and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our
        servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>
    <p>This license does not grant FRCScout the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of
        our provision of the Service.</p>
    <h4>5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>
    <p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users'
        repositories, may be viewed by others.</p>
    <h4>6. Moral Rights</h4>
    <p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service,
        including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them
        against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights, but not otherwise.</p>
    <p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant FRCScout the rights we need to use
        Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the
        Website and provide the Service.</p>

    <h3>E. API Terms</h3>
    <h4>No Abuse or Overuse of the API</h4>
    <p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to FRCScout via the API may result in the temporary or permanent
        suspension of your Account's access to the API. FRCScout, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or
        excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>
    <p>You may not share API tokens to exceed FRCScout's rate limitations.</p>
    <p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from FRCScout for spamming purposes, including for the
        purposes of selling FRCScout users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job
        boards.</p>
    <p>All use of the FRCScout API is subject to these Terms of Service and the FRCScout Privacy Statement.</p>

    <h3>F. Termination</h3>
    <h4>FRCScout May Terminate</h4>
    <p>FRCScout has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or
        without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. FRCScout reserves the right to refuse service to
        anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

    <h3>G. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
    <p>FRCScout provides the Website and the Service "as is" and "as available," without warranty of any kind. Without
        limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the
        Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular
        purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.</p>
    <p>FRCScout does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted,
        timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or
        correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time
        or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility
        and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material
        obtained from the Service.</p>

    <h3>H. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use,
        goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however
        arising, that result from</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;</li>
        <li>your use or inability to use the Service;</li>
        <li>any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;</li>
        <li>the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;</li>
        <li>unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;</li>
        <li>statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;</li>
        <li>any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or</li>
        <li>any other matter relating to the Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a
        remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability
        for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.</p>

    <h3>I. Release and Indemnification</h3>
    <p>If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release FRCScout from any and all claims, demands and
        damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way
        connected with such disputes.</p>
    <p>You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and
        expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not
        limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that FRCScout (1) promptly gives you written notice of the
        claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim,
        demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the
        settlement unconditionally releases FRCScout of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable
        assistance, at your expense.</p>

    <h3>J. Changes to These Terms</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these
        Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this
        Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our
        Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our
        revisions of these Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the
        Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.</p>

    <h3>K. Miscellaneous</h3>
    <h4>1. Governing Law</h4>
    <p>Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and FRCScout and any access to
        or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the
        laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and FRCScout agree to submit
        to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco,
        California.</p>
    <h4>2. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival</h4>
    <p>If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed
        to reflect the parties' original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any
        failure on the part of FRCScout to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of
        our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this
        Agreement.</p>
